# World Clock: Manila â€“ Dubai â€“ Amsterdam

While waiting for my wife to travel from **Manila (Philippines)** to **Amsterdam (The Netherlands)**, I wanted a clock that could display the current local time in these locations. I also included **Dubai**, since her flight had a layover there.

I used **ChatGPT** to generate a Python script that displays **three analog clocks**, each showing the time in one of these cities. After some tweaking and customization, this is the final result.
